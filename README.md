# belly-button-challenge

For this challeng I used tips from onChange Javascript event | Javascript Events | Javascript Tutorials https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb1nT75ZlTg and JavaScript OnChange Event Change BG Color https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASw6rc289VI to be ablo to build the drop down list and get the plots to update as I sleected the IDs

In this challenge I faced a lot of trouble with an error reagrding on change and optionChanged: "Uncaught ReferenceError: optionChanged is not defined at HTMLSelectElement.onchange ((index):25:72) how and where i need to define optionChange" to fix this I used Chat GPT prompts where i got te recomendation to define the optionChanged function before the rest of the code to avoid errors and it worked
